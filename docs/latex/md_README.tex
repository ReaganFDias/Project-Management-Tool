Using the file system as the main datastore, this tool helps manage work breakdown methodology, milestones and time management.

The core elements will be strongly guided, and completion of them equates to approximately 40\% of the marks. Beyond that, students should problem solve, in a graded hierarchy of difficulty and completion to achieve higher marks.

{\bfseries{It is unrealistic to expect to meet all the feature criteria listed}}

Part of the task therefore involves deciding which elements to implement in order to maximise your mark.

Some of the features may be best implemented using shell (bash or zsh) scripting, or could be done directly in C.

Tests will be provided for 1...10, which will also define the command line arguments required (including the sub-\/command name for the features, where appropriate e.\+g. pm feature feature\+\_\+name or pm feature move new\+\_\+feature\+\_\+name ).

Coursework submission will include creating project documentation (using doxygen) so code {\itshape {\bfseries{must}}} be well commented. Any shell scripts or make files included in the solution {\itshape {\bfseries{must}}} be included in the documentation. The submission itself {\itshape {\bfseries{must}}} be the U\+RL of the C\+S\+Git\+Lab repository used.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Core functionality\+:}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Be able to create basic file structure for project
\item Abort if requested project/feature name already exists under \textquotesingle{}root\textquotesingle{} folder. Here \textquotesingle{}root\textquotesingle{} does not mean the / root of the file system, but the folder from which the program is run.
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Requires checking existing file system for matching name
\item Requires using branching ({\itshape if}) to exit program if necessary
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Initialise git repository
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Should}}} set up C\+S\+Git\+Lab project etc.

\item Feature management
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Must}}} implement a method of having a shorthand code for feature e.\+g. F1, F2.\+1..., stored in a file.
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Must}}} implement lookup to facilitate getting path from shorthand code

\item Requires tree walk (iterative or recursive)
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Must}}} exclude folders that start with a \textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{}
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Should}}} use the plantuml tool
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Could}}} implement from scratch (much harder, more marks)

\item Time/workload estimate information stored in files in subfolders
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape {\bfseries{Should}}} have mechanisms for adding these from the program not just editing the files

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Guided work breakdown wizard (Slightly advanced, would require interactive questions/answer handling)
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Needs a number of sub-\/features, such as minimum time allocation threshold, user input parsing
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Multi-\/user (Advanced, would require some form of permissions model)
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item may be best done using a traditional S\+QL database, but can use flat files. Complex task.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Available as web application (Advanced, probably easiest creating a simple embedded server)
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item sample code for simple communications between applications will be covered
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item G\+O\+AP recommendation of suitable pathway (Advanced, can use existing G\+O\+AP library, however)
